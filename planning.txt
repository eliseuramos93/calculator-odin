ROADMAP 
[OK] create basic UI
[OK] enable number button activity
[OK] enable function button activity
[OK] enable add button activity
  [OK] enable operate function
  [OK] enable callToAction function
  [OK] link callToAction button w/ sum button
[OK] enable remaining operations button activity
[OK] enable chain operation logic

// types of operation
  // simpleOperation = if called w/ equal
    // consecutiveEqual flag turned on
  // chainOperation = if called w/ operation sign
    //consecutiveOperator boolean flag;
      //if equal operator, do nothing;
      //if different operator, call changeOperation;
// negate consecutive operator button presses;
  // consecutiveOperator boolean flag;
  // consecutiveEqual boolean flag;

/*
possible "call to action" scenarios:
WHEN THE MEMORY IS EMPTY
  [ ] user inputs a number then presses an operation button;
  [ ] user is returning from a operation ended w/ "=" then press an operation button;
WHEN THERE IS VALUES ALLOCATED IN THE MEMORY ARRAY
  [ ] user inputs a number then presses the equal sign;
    -> simpleOperation function;
      -> call operate;
      -> clear memory
  [ ] user inputs a number then presses another operation sign;
    -> chainOperation function;
      -> call operate;
      -> prepare memory for next input;
WEIRD BEHAVIOR
  [ ] consecutive operation presses
    [ ] same operation button being pressed
      -> ignore action;
    [ ] different operation button being pressed
      -> changeOperation function;
        -> change operation in memory;
  [ ] multiple equal signs presses
    * with empty memory
      -> ignore action;
    * with allocated memory
      -> ignore action
  [ ] user press a number after returning an operation
    [ ] turn resetInputFlag ON!
